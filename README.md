# De-makeup

### Ongoing Project
This project aims to create a neural network model that can automatically remove makeup from facial images. It is built using ResNet34 with UNet architecture and trained on a custom dataset of facial images with and without makeup.

# 1. Project Overview:
De-makeup using ResNet34 with UNet is a project that uses deep learning techniques to automatically remove makeup from facial images. The model is trained on a custom dataset of facial images with and without makeup, and the output is a de-makeup image that accurately represents the user's natural appearance. This project has many potential applications in the beauty industry and beyond, including personal photo albums, social media, and online beauty stores. By making it easier for individuals to see themselves without makeup and providing more accurate product depictions, De-makeup can help promote more authentic beauty standards.
